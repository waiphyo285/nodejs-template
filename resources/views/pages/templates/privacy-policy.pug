    h1 Privacy Policy
    p Last updated: November 26, 2025

    p DaisyChord ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application DaisyChord (the "App"). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.

    // SECTION 1
    h2 1. Information We Collect
    p We collect information that you provide directly to us and information that is automatically collected when you use the App.

    h3 1.1 Information You Provide
    ul
      li Song request information: When you submit a song request, we collect the song title, artist name, optional email address, and optional additional information.
      li App preferences: Settings you configure within the App, including theme (light/dark), font size, auto-scroll settings, and scroll speed.

    h3 1.2 Automatically Collected Information
    ul
      li Network requests: When you browse songs, artists, bands, or chords, the App fetches content from our servers.
      li Analytics data: We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymized usage data (screen views, feature usage), device information (model, OS version), and crash reports.

    // SECTION 2
    h2 2. How We Use Your Information
    p We use the information we collect to:
    ul
      li Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features.
      li Process and respond to your song requests.
      li Apply your app preferences (theme, font size, scroll settings).
      li Fetch and display song, artist, band, and chord information.

    // SECTION 3
    h2 3. Data Storage and Security
    p Your app preferences are stored locally on your device using secure storage. Song requests are stored on our servers to process your requests.

    p We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure.

    p The guitar tuner feature uses microphone/audio access to detect guitar pitch. Audio is processed locally on your device in real-time and is never stored, recorded, or transmitted. Recording stops when you exit the tuner.

    // SECTION 4
    h2 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
    p We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information. We may share data only in these situations:
    ul
      li Service providers performing services on our behalf (e.g., hosting).
      li Legal requirements (law, court order, government request).
      li Business transfers (merger, acquisition, asset sale).
      li With your explicit consent.

    // SECTION 5
    h2 5. Third-Party Services
    p The App fetches song, artist, band, and chord data from our servers. Song requests are also sent to our servers for processing.

    ul
      li Google Analytics for Firebase: Collects anonymized usage data, device information, and crash reports to improve app performance. Data does not personally identify you.

    p If additional third-party services are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated.

    // SECTION 6
    h2 6. Permissions
    p The App may request the following permissions:

    ul
      li Internet: Required to fetch song, artist, band, and chord data, and to submit song requests.
      li Microphone/Audio Recording (Android): Used for the guitar tuner to detect pitch. Audio is processed locally and never stored or sent.

    // SECTION 7
    h2 7. Your Rights and Choices
    p Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:

    ul
      li Access: Review your app preferences stored locally.
      li Deletion: Delete local app preferences via settings or uninstall the App. Song requests already submitted cannot be deleted.
      li Correction: Update your app preferences in the App settings.
      li Opt-out: You may choose not to provide optional information such as email when submitting requests.

    p To exercise your rights, please contact us using the email provided below.

    // SECTION 8
    h2 8. Data Retention
    p Local app preferences remain until deleted by you or until the App is uninstalled. Song requests stored on our servers may be kept for processing and reasonable record-keeping. Uninstalling the App deletes only local data.

    // SECTION 9
    h2 9. Children's Privacy
    p The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum legal age). We do not knowingly collect information from children. Parents may contact us to request deletion of any such data.
